# Frontend Web

## Pretty Javascript vertical slider making pictures come together with descriptions.
> [!NOTE]
> I made this following along a turtorial to make my own project from!
> This is made when I still was learning Javascript tricks and mastering the basics.

### I like it, feel free to make your own page using these functions.
1. ***I'm cleaning up my .md files and going to delete some of my first projects that just taking up space***
   - Most of my respitories right now is a path I can look back on how I progressed.
     - This is a good project to do if you want to see the more advanced functions you can make with plain javascript.
       - Would be perfect for starting page as personal website, but I already started on something else.    

2. ***Practicing frontend skills!***
   - Will update this project when I got time, make it more serious and bigger, updates will be written here to the project!
      - Todo next, make every page more meaningful and niched to some buisness model.
